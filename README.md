🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to investigate how writing habits—such as sentence structure, word choice, and frequency—affect scoring models. Using data-driven analysis, we aim to uncover insights into how certain writing styles influence evaluation outcomes.

📊 Data
The dataset consists of written samples along with associated scores, sourced from the Kaggle competition. Features extracted include:

Linguistic features: Sentence length, word frequency, vocabulary richness
Structural features: Paragraph length, coherence, transitions
Stylistic features: Use of passive/active voice, sentiment analysis
